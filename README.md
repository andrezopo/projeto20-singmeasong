## Test Reference

### In order to properly do the tests, you must follow some instructions

## Environment Variables Back-end

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file and .env.test file

`DATABASE_URL = postgres://UserName:Password@Hostname:5432/DatabaseName # in .env.test recommended /DatabaseName_test`

`PORT = number #recommended:5000`

</br>

## Environment Variables Front-end

In Front-end, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000 #must use the same port number as the PORT in Back-end`

</br>

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/andrezopo/projeto20-singmeasong
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd projeto20-singmeasong/
```

Install dependencies both in front-end and back-end

```bash
  npm install
```

Install dev dependencies in back-end

```bash
  npm install dotenv-cli jest prisma supertest ts-jest ts-node typescrypt nodemon eslint @faker-js/faker @types/cors @types/dotenv @types/express @types/jest @types/joi @types/node @types/supertest -D
```

Create database both in test and production environment

```bash
  npx dotenv -e .env.test prisma migrate dev && npx dotenv -e .env.test prisma db seed
```
```bash
  npx prisma migrate dev && npx prisma db seed
```
Install dev dependencies in front-end

```bash
  npm install cypress @types/jest @faker-js/faker -D
```

Start the both back-end and front-end servers

## Back-end

```bash
  npm run dev
```
## Front-end

```bash
  npm start
```

Now you're free to run the tests of the project and create your own

## To run the tests in back-end use the following commands in shell

### Unit tests

```bash
  npm run test:unit
```

### Integration tests

```bash
  npm run test:integration
```

</br>

## Lessons Learned

In this project I learned a lot about testing back-end function and routes through Jest, mocking other functions to isolate the unit testing ones and learned how to manipulate cypress
